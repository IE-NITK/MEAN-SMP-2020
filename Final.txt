Final Project - MEAN Stack SMP
Note:- This project can be done in teams of 2-3 or you can be a sole contributor too.

Problem Statement

Design and implement a mini-medium (blog) application where users can log in and post their articles, edit it, and delete the post if they wish too.

The minimal features your application should have are:-
1) Authentication of users: You can use passport.js or OAuth using firebase if you wish to.
2) Landing page: Feel free to check out pages like Medium, The IE Blog, or any other blog for ideas.
3) It should show all the blog posts with the user who posted
4) CRUD: Perform CRUD operations as mentioned in the problem statement. Refer to this.
5) Option to like/upvote the post to authorized users.

Technical Details

1) The framework used to make the application should be using either all or most of MEAN
2) All pages should be responsive (feel free to use templates)
3) The database schema of the whole application must be normalized. Go through this link for better understanding.
4) Create a public GitHub repo and share the link with the mentors. Make sure to commit code regularly. If you have deployed on any cloud service you can add the demo link to your readme file and update the team details.

Bonus Tasks

1) Have a comment section for each post
2) Deploy this application on any cloud platform of your choice. (Azure, Google Cloud, AWS, Heroku, any other of your choice)


Note: The deadline to submit the application is 8th August 2020, 11:59 PM. If you have any doubts you can PM any of the mentors.
